The example of the Prophet Muhammad was one which the West African resistant al-hajj Muhammad al-Amin sought to emulate. A precondition of his claim to leadership was the creation of an Islamic religious community of sufficient ideological credentials to justify brutal wars against rival Muslim states, in addition to the Christian French and non-Islamic African peoples. In this respect, it would be a project following the example of West African antecedents in the tradition of Jihad like Usman dan Fodio and Umar Tall, figures Muhamamd al-Amin took direct inspiration from.

 In addition, the  lettered, Jakhanke-Soninke scholarly milieu in which Muhammad al-Amin was formed, most notably in Goundiourou, had developed their own prophetology– their own conception of the theological and institutional role of mainly the Prophet Muhammad– but also of other prophets of the Quran, as gleaned from sources such as the Quran and highly popular biographical materials and poetry which circulated throughout the Sahara. One observable outlet of this prophetology appears in the genre of original epic poems that Arabic-literate scholars authored in the middle of the 19th century, the “biniiboo”, or prophetic praise poems. 
 
 For my portfolio, I hope to complete a digital humanities project which can perform a frequency analysis on selections of a long and important example of this poem authored by the scholar . The project would aim to guage whether Mecca or Medina/Taybah is mentioned more in the reading. Once this is done and the model has been trained to recognize these strings, a secondary project can be to look at the kinds of episodes that are evoked most strongly in the poem around these places. Hopefully, this will create a methodology by which, later in the thesis, I can work with other examples of praise poetry to make claims about the Soninke scholarly community’s understanding of the prophets and of leadership of a Muslim community, in the period leading up to Muhammad Al-Amin’s taking up of an explicit military-political role as leader of a Jihad movement.


Practically, in this project I would have to begin by digitizing the document of a little over 300 folios, then apply a transcription model, similar to other projects we have completed in the digital humanities course. Then, I would have to begin coding a simple python loop which can look through the transcription and pull the data I choose. In this case the number of occurrences of Medina and Mecca, as well as listing the page number of each appearance in the text. This would give me some data I can work with, in addition to allowing me to create a method for future use in digital humanities projects.
