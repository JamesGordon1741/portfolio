Several numerical values are used to evaluate HTR. These incldue WAR, CAR, CER, and WER, which matehmatically represent the difference between a text and a given model's digital reproduction of it.
While HTR models are sufficient broadly for developing a model, they might cover up certain intricacies which can be useful when analyizing a text. It is common to have different expectations for different kind of texts when the relative effeciency of a model based on its CER value. For some standardized texts, such as those written on a typewriter or printed from computer text in a common, romanized language, nothing less than a CER of 1% can be considered a good outcome. Conversely, a benchmark of 20% can be good for an idiosyncratically handwritten and obscure content, whether this be language or spelling. Some textual traditions might be considered to be singular, and therefore it might
