The example of the Prophet Muhammad was one which the West African resistant al-hajj Muhammad al-Amin sought to emulate. A precondition of his claim to leadership was the creation of an Islamic religious community of sufficient ideological credentials to perform wars against rival Muslim states, in addition to the Christian French and non-Islamic African peoples. In this respect, it would be a project following the example of antecedents like Umar Dan Fodio and Umar Tall, who Muhamamd al-Amin took direct inspiration from.

 The lettered, Jakhanke-Soninke scholarly milieu in which Muhammad al-Amin was formed, most notably in Goundiourou, had developed their own prophetology– their own conception of the theological and institutional role of mainly the Prophet Muhammad– but also of other prophets of the Quran, as gleaned from sources such as the Quran and assorted biographical materials which circulated throughout the Sahara. One observable outlet of this prophetic science appears in the genre of original epic poems that Soninke Ajami and Arabic-literate scholars authored in the middle of the 19th century, the “biniiboo” or praise poems. For my project I hope to complete a project which can perform a frequency analysis on selections of a long and important example of this poem authored by the scholar . The project would aim to guage whether Mecca or Medina/Taybah is mentioned more in the reading. Once this is done and the model has been trained to recognize these strings, a secondary project can be to look at the kinds of episodes that are evoked most strongly in the poem around these places. Hopefully, this will create a methodology by which, later in the thesis, I can work with other examples of praise poetry to make claims about the Soninke scholarly community’s understanding of the prophet and leadership of a Muslim community in the time leading up to Muhammad Al-Amin’s taking of a military role.


Practically, in this project I would have to begin by digitizing the document of about 300 pages, then apply a transcription model, similar to other projects we have completed. Then, I would have to begin coding a python loop which can look through the transcription and pull the data I want, in this case the number of occurrences of Medina and Mecca, as well as listing the page number of each appearance in the text. This would give me some data I can work with, in addition to allowing me to work on something that will
