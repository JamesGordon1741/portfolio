## mini-project 1: 

This mini-project is about digitizing texts.
We'll learn best practices for scanning a book, and we'll convert the scanned images in computer-readable text in a process called OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Through this process, we'll get our first introduction about Machine Learning.
